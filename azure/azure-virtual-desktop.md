# Azure Virtual Desktop
  
Azure Virtual Desktop is a **desktop and application virtualization** service that runs on the cloud. It enables you to use a cloud-hosted version of Windows from any location.

It's a remote desktop that can be accessed by any OS and by browser.

Advantages:

- **security**: data is not stored on a local laptop, which can be stolen;
- **permission management**: centralize roles and ACL;
- **secure network**: all the [[azure-virtual-machines|VMs]] stored via Azure Virtual Desktop have secure outbond communication;
- integration with [[azure-active-directory|Azure AD]] using MFA.
