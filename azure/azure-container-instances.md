# Azure Container Instances

You don't have to manage VMs.

Azure Container Instances is a [[paas]] service.

You can upload your single containers and have them run in the cloud in a single _pod_.

Concepts like scaling, load balancing, and certificates are _not_ provided with ACI containers. For example, to scale to five container instances, you create five distinct container instances.
