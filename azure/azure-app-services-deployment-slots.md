# Azure App Services Deployment Slots

When you deploy your web app, you can use a separate deployment slot instead of the default production slot when you're running in the **Standard App Service Plan tier or better**.

Deployment slots are live apps **with their own host names**.

App content and configuration elements can be swapped between two deployment slots, including the production slot.
