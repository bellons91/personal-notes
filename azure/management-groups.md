# Management groups

Management groups are a way to organize [[subscriptions|Azure Subscriptions]].

Having Management groups is helpful when you have to deal with multiple clients, and you want to organize bills, policies, and compliance in a centralized way.

**Management groups can be nested** up to 6 levels of depth.
