# Azure Availability Zones

Availability zones are physically separate datacenters within an [[azure-region|Azure region]].

Each availability zone is independent, and the internal datacenters have independent power, cooling, and networking. They are **isolated** from other Availability Zones.

Availability Zones are connected through a secure, high-speed network.

**Not all Azure Regions currently support availability zones.** When a Region supports Availability Zones, there are at least three zones within that region.

## Practical usage

- achieve **high-availability**
- co-locate computing, storage, networking
- replicate data

## Azure Services that support Availability Zones

Not every Azure Service supports Availability Zones (sometimes, it's not even necessary).

There are 3 categories of service usage:

1. **Zonal services**: a service is pinned to a specific zone. Eg: [[azure-virtual-machines]], IP Addresses; 
2. **Zone-redundant service**: some services are replicated across several zones (eg: [[Azure SQL]]);
3. **Non-regional services**: some services must be available regardless of the actual location so they span across worldwide zones.
