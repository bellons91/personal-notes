# Azure Container Apps

It's a [[paas]] service.

You don't have to manage containers manually.

Optimized for running general purpose containers, especially for applications that span many microservices deployed in containers.

They incorporate **Service Discovery**, **Load Balancing** and **Scaling**.

Azure Container Apps doesn't provide direct access to the underlying Kubernetes APIs. If you require access to the Kubernetes APIs and control plane, you should use [[azure-kubernetes-service]].
